This paper proposes a web-based automated proctoring system designed to improve online exam integrity by detecting cheating behaviors in real time. It combines YOLOv8 object detection to recognize faces and restricted objects with gaze-based analysis to monitor eye movement and head orientation. A rule-based decision layer integrates these signals with browser activity patterns to identify suspicious behavior and generate alerts. The system is lightweight, works within a browser environment, and demonstrates reliable performance in monitoring remote examinations.
