# Fine-Tuning BART for News Summarization

## Overview
An abstractive text summarization system built by fine-tuning the BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) model on news datasets. The project focuses on generating concise, human-readable summaries from lengthy news articles.

## Key Features
- Fine-tuned BART model for optimal summarization performance
- Trained on XSum and CNN/DailyMail datasets
- Generates abstractive summaries that capture key information
- Natural language understanding and generation capabilities

## Technologies Used
- BART (Transformers)
- Python
- PyTorch/TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers

## Datasets
- XSum: Extreme summarization dataset
- CNN/DailyMail: News article summarization dataset

## Applications
- News aggregation platforms
- Content curation systems
- Automated report generation
- Quick information extraction from long articles
