## About Me

Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence are at the core of my academic and research pursuits. My work focuses on developing systems that advance machine understanding of language and visual data, building intelligent solutions that can process text, recognize images, and interpret complex visual scenes through deep learning approaches.

Large language models, image recognition, and multilingual AI systems represent key areas of exploration in my research. The ultimate aim is to create accessible and scalable technology that addresses real world challenges and contributes to making the world a better place.
