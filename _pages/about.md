## About Me

I am deeply engaged in the study of Artificial Intelligence, with a particular focus on natural language processing, computer vision, and multimodal learning. I am driven by the challenge of designing systems that can interpret complex text, analyze visual data, and integrate information across these different modalities. My work primarily involves large language models, transformer architectures, and deep neural networks. I also explore representation learning and generative modeling to improve how machines perceive and reason about the world.

This interest is supported by a solid foundation in core Computer Science. This foundation enables me to approach AI research with a practical engineering perspective, ensuring that theoretical concepts can be translated into efficient and scalable systems. My long term goal is to bridge the gap between academic research and practical application, developing AI technologies that are beneficial for real world use.
