## About Me

I'm broadly interested in how machines can learn to see and understand the world. My work sits at the intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. I build systems that can read and reason about text, recognize objects and scenes in images, and connect what they "see" with what they "read," mainly using deep learning methods.

Lately, I've been focusing on large language models, image recognition, and multilingual AI systems. A big part of my motivation is making sure these technologies are not just impressive in theory, but actually useful and accessible in practice, scalable tools that help address real-world problems and can be used by people from different backgrounds and regions.


## Research Interests

My research interests are several key areas within Natural Language Processing and AI:

- **Deep Learning**
- **Neural Networks**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
- **Generative AI**
- **Responsible and Ethical AI**
- **Multimodal Learning**
